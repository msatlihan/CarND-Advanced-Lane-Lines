# Advanced Lane Finding Project

The aim of this project is to write a more robust lane line finding algorithm to deal with complex senarios like curving lines, shadows and changes in the color of the pavement.

For the implementation details and the results please visit the [project report](./project-report.md).

And an extra solution for the severe shadow cases is given and the results are demonstrated in this additional [report](./challenge-illuminant-invariance-solution.ipynb).
